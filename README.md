## Physics-Informed Resolution-Enhancing GANs (PhIRE GANs)

This repository contains code for the model described in 

Stengel K., Glaws A., Hettinger D., King R. "Adversarial super-resolution of climatological wind and solar data". PNAS July 21, 2020 117 (29) 16805-16815; first published July 6, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1918964117

### Requirements
- Python v3.7
- TensorFlow v1.12
- numpy v1.15
- matplotlib v3.1
- netCDF4 1.4.1 --> newer versions produce a DLL loader error when in debug mode ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

A conda environment YML file, `tf_env.yml` has been provided for your convenience. 

### Data

##### WIND Toolkit & NSRDB
LR, MR, and HR wind example data (from WIND Toolkit) can be found in `example_data/`. These datasets are from NREL's WIND Toolkit. The LR and MR data are to be used with the MR and HR models respectively. If you would like to use your own data for the super-resolution it must have the shape: (N_batch, height, width, [ua, va]). Example solar data (from NSRDB) can also be found in `example_data/` and can be treated in the same manner as the WIND Toolkit is treated. If you choose to use your own solar data it should have the shape: (N_batch, height, width, [DNI, DHI]).
The scripts are designed to take in TFRecords. Methods for converting numpy arrays into compatible TFRecords are available in `utils.py`.

##### CCSM
If you would like to run the CCSM wind data through the pretrained PhIREGANs models, you can download the data from [here](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/) with the following:
- project : CMIP5
- model : CCSM4
- experiment : 1% per year CO<sub>2</sub>
- time_frequency : day
- realm : atmos
- ensemble : r2i1p1
- version : 20130218
- variables : ua, va (for wind), and rsds (for solar)
CCSM solar data is converted from daily to hourly average values using the TAG model. The CCSM GHI data is split into DNI and DHI components using the DISC model.

### Model Weights
Model weights can be found in `models/`. The wind MR and HR models perform a 10x and 5x super-resolution respectively while both solar models perform a 5x super-resolution. Each model is designed to work on the distance scales they were trained on (100 to 10km or 10km to 2km/4km). If you wish to have a different amount of super-resolution you must train the models accordingly.

### Running the Models
An example of how to use the PhIRE GANs model for training and testing can be found in `main.py`.
